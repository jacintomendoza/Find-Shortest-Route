Java
----------------------------

Code is structured as one whole file with Node classes for each individual city that are organized around the nodes to find the optimal path.

How to run the code using linux example:

javac find_route.java
java find_route input1.txt Bremen Kassel h_kassel.txt

-----------------------------

Notes:

- Not sure if it can be ran using omega as it was only used on Linux.
- Throws a out of bounds exception because of args but still runs nonetheless.
